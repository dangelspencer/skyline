## Project Sought
I would like to build a front end for the [Triton DataCenter API](https://github.com/joyent/triton). The reason for this is there is currently no open source solution for spinning up and managing basic virtual machines. Right now to spin up a vm, you'd have to log into the datacenter software and go through some potentially confusing prompts if you're not familiar with building virtual machines. The goal would be to create a simple user interface that allows a user without any technical background the ability to create and manage virtual machines.
