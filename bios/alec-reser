  ## Project Sought
  
  I am seeking to design an open-source UI for Trition Data Center. The application will allow users to log in, manage (create/delete/update) VM's purchased from a company using Trition. This will solve an maintenance issue considering Trition manually does all changes to VM's through the customer. This responsibility will now be with the user and will take a large load of work off of the company's support representatives.
