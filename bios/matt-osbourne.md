## Project Sought
```
I am seeking to create a full User Interface for the Trition DataCenter cloud management platform. Exactly as
Trition is, the software will be created and made open-source. The finished product of this project will be a 
fully functioning user interface that allows users to log in, manage their account, and to create, update, and
maintain their own virtual machines that are purchased from a company that has deployed Trition as well as this 
user interface. The problem this project solves is that there currently is not a self service software solution 
for Trition DataCenter. Currently, the company that owns the server Trition is running on must handle all 
creation and updates of the virtual machines they manage, this will allow the customer to control everything 
related to their virtual machines directly, without going through a customer support representative.
