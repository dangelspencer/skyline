### Project Background/Description
This project is to create an open source, full User Interface for the [Triton DataCenter](https://github.com/joyent/triton) cloud management platform. The finished product of this project will be a fully functioning user interface that allows users to log in, manage their account, and to create, update, and maintain their own virtual machines that are purchased from a company that has deployed Triton as well as this user interface.

The reason this project will be different from other solutions is that it will be free to use, open source, and available for everyone. While interfaces like this exist for companies that sell virtual machines, the software that they use was developed in house and is generally proprietary. The Triton DataCenter platform is completely open source and free for anyone to use and configure on their own hardware, and the finished product of this project will enhance the usability of Triton DataCenter. This will enable anyone to set up and manage their own data center on their own hardware, and make it easier for the end user to create, edit, and use their virtual machines.

### Project Problem Statement
Currently, there is not a free and open source user interface available for Triton DataCenter that is consumer facing. The only interface that is available for Triton DataCenter is for the company that owns the physical server that the Triton DataCenter software is running on. The issue with this is that for a consumer to set up or modify a virtual machine they pay for (or wish to) is to get in contact with the company that owns the server and have them make the change. This software will enable anyone to set up and manage their own virtual machines without needing any sort of customer support or assistance.

Another thing this project aims to do is eliminate as many choices as possible for the end user. When setting up a virtual machine in VMWare, for example, you have to choose what drive it will be stored on, what network interface it will connect to, and give it an .iso to load an operating system from. Our project aims to deliver a user interface that removes the choices that can be made by the system and therefore streamline the process as much as possible for the end user. A stretch goal for the project would be to give the user a list of operating systems to choose from instead of requiring them to upload their own. Also, with both our project and Triton DataCenter being open source, anyone would be able to create a complete virtualization environment without having to pay for any of the software.

### Team's approach to the problem
We plan to document all steps and use the agile model to plan sprints for completing this project. Our overall goals are to have a web interface where any user can:
* Sign up for an account
* Add and manage account details
* Create and manage virtual machines
* Pay for virtual machines usage
* Delete Virtual Machines
* Close Account

Our final expectations for our product to demo are:
* Be able to enter the web interface and create an account
* When on the account, update account and payment details
* Select Virtual Machine specifications and spin up Virtual Machine
* Change Specifications of Virtual Machine and update
* Delete Virtual Machine
* Close Account
