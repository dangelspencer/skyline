### Project Background/Description
This project is to create an open source, full User Interface for the Trition DataCenter cloud management platform. The finished product of this project will be a fully functioning user interface that allows users to log in, manage their account, and to create, update, and maintain their own virtual machines that are purchased from a company that has deployed Trition as well as this user interface.

### Project Problem Statement
Currently, there is not a free and open source user interface available for Trition DataCenter that is consumer facing. The only interface that is available for Trition DataCenter is for the company that owns the physical server that the Trition DataCenter software is running on. The issue with this is that for a consumer to set up or modify a virtual machine they pay for (or wish to) is to get in contact with the company that owns the server and have them make the change. This software will enable anyone to set up and manage their own virtual machines without needing any sort of customer support or assistance.

### Team's approach to the problem
We plan to document all steps and use the agile model to plan through completing this project. Our overall goals are to have a web interface where any user can:
* Sign up for an account
* Add and manage account details
* Create and manage virtual machines
* Pay for virtual machines usage
* Delete Virtual Machines
* Close Account

Our final expectations for our product to demo are:
* Be able to enter the web interface and create an account
* When on the account, update account and payment details
* Select Virtual Machine specifications and spin up Virtual Machine
* Change Specifications of Virtual Machine and update
* Delete Virtual Machine
* Close Account
